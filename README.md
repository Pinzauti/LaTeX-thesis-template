# LaTeX Thesis Template
Clean LaTeX template for a thesis or a large writeup. You can see [here](https://github.com/Pinzauti/LaTeX-thesis-template/releases/download/v1.0/template.pdf) the generated PDF.

## Requirements
You need a working LaTeX enviroment installed in your system.
#### Minted
If you want to add source code to your document and therefore use the [minted package](https://ctan.org/pkg/minted?lang=en), you need to make sure to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the [pygments package](https://pygments.org/) installed in your system. You can take a look at the [documentation](http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/minted/minted.pdf) to have a better insight.

If you use an editor to compile the template (e.g. TeXstudio, Visual Studio etc.) you should add the flag ```-shell-escape``` when compiling.

Note that this setup is default but not mandatory for the template, if you don't need to write code in your document just remove the minted package from the ```config.tex``` file (and of course the example code in the first chapter).

## Getting started

In order to compile the template you just need to navigate to the ```src``` folder and execute the command:

```
make
```

If you want to manually compile the template you have to do the following:
- Compile the file ```main.tex```.
- Compile the file ```main-frn.tex```.
- Compile (yes, again) the file ```main.tex```.

We are using `pdflatex` but you can use wheter you prefer.

#### Overleaf
If you use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) just uncomment [these lines](https://github.com/Pinzauti/LaTeX-thesis-template/blob/main/src/FrontBack/Frontespizio.tex#L24) and compile the file as usual.

It contains some pre-included packages and defines the ```\abs``` command for the absolute value. It also defines the ambients ```Postulate```, ```Definition``` and ```Theorem```. More info [here](http://www.ams.org/arc/tex/amscls/amsthdoc.pdf).
